# 💫 About Me: [![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-%230077B5.svg?logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://linkedin.com/in/talha-ather) [![email](https://img.shields.io/badge/Email-D14836?logo=gmail&logoColor=white)](mailto:talha.ather03@gmail.com) 
My name is Talha Ather, and I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, magna cum laude, with a 3.97 GPA.

I’m passionate about building things that solve real problems. My experience spans full-stack web development, machine learning, cybersecurity, and network systems. More than anything, I care about building technology that uplifts people and creates lasting impact.

One of my proudest moments was co-founding GoodWatt, a sustainability-focused startup that won both CU Boulder’s 2024 Sustainability Hackathon and the 2025 Social Impact New Venture Challenge. I led the technical development of our secure preorder platform using Next.js, TypeScript, and Stripe.

I also supported the marketing automation platform at Total Expert, contributing to full-stack development using Vue.js, SQL, PHP, and ElasticSearch. There, I worked on backend performance, frontend modularity, and system debugging at scale.

Whether I’m in the classroom, working on a new project, or shipping production code, I’m driven by curiosity, collaboration, and purpose.
