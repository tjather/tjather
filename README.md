My Name is Talha Ather and I am a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Colorado Boulder. I'm passionate about building innovative, efficient, and scalable solutions that solve real-world problems. My background includes full-stack web development and hands-on experience in machine learning, cybersecurity, and network systems.

Whether I‚Äôm taking classes, refining a backend system, or launching a product, I‚Äôm driven by curiosity, collaboration, and the desire to make a meaningful impact through technology. I‚Äôm actively seeking opportunities where I can continue learning, grow alongside experienced teams, and contribute to high-impact software projects.

üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on building WattGuard, a smart plug that cuts phantom energy waste at the source. We're combining hardware, software, and sustainability to tackle a silent but costly problem in homes and businesses.<br><br>üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on meaningful, mission-driven tech, especially projects that uplift underserved communities, promote sustainability, or serve the Muslim ummah.<br><br>ü§ù I‚Äôm looking for help with scaling WattGuard‚Äôs infrastructure, especially around embedded systems, energy benchmarking, and e-commerce logistics.<br><br>üå± I‚Äôm currently learning more about embedded Linux, power optimization techniques, and how to build resilient infrastructure for production-ready IoT.<br><br>üí¨ Ask me about building MVPs fast, product-market validation, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Laravel, or how to start something from nothing and pitch it like you mean it.<br><br>‚ö° Fun fact: I currently led a team that won both a university hackathon and a social impact venture competition with the same product. I‚Äôve also studied the Islamic sciences through Qalam Seminary and am always trying to merge code and khidmah.<br>
