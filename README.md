## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Talha Ather and I am a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Colorado Boulder. I'm passionate about building innovative, efficient, and scalable solutions that solve real-world problems. My background includes full-stack web development and hands-on experience in machine learning, cybersecurity, and network systems.

Whether Iâ€™m taking classes, refining a backend system, or launching a product, Iâ€™m driven by curiosity, collaboration, and the desire to make a meaningful impact through technology. Iâ€™m actively seeking opportunities where I can continue learning, grow alongside experienced teams, and contribute to high-impact software projects.
